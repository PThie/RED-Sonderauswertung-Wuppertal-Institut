# RWI-GEO-RED Sonderauswertung für Wuppertal Institut für Klima, Umwelt und Energie

## Task:

### Regional restriction
- Restriction to the areas of Wuppertal and Mannheim for all four data sources (sales and rents)

### Additional spatial information
- Adding spatial information on building block and city district ("Quartierebene")

### Protected historic building
- Adding information on whether the building is protected due to historical reasons
- Note: The data sets on sales already include such a variable. However, the data sets on rents do not have such a variable.
    - Add the information to the sales data set as well and see how good both metrics compare.
- This analysis is only required for the city of Wuppertal.
